# FPGA-Based-Image-Processing-Module

This repository contains open source FPGA-based image processing modules, including:

	1. Sharpen Filter: to sharp the images
	2. Smooth Filter with 3 by 3 kernel window (Gaussian Approximation) : to smooth the images
	3. Sobel Filter : to detect the egdes

All these modules use Sliding Window technique to increase the throughput of modules.

In each folder there is VHDL codes and respective documentation.
